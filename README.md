# Emulating-Cache-In-memory

Designed a Direct Mapped cache and a 4-way Set Associative Cache each of size 256kB. We used a trace file which have lakhs of code for input. I have used the LRU (least recently used) replacement policy for the replacement in set associative cache. The element which will be replaced will have the “lowest  recent number”.
